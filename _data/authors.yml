    I'm Xiao, currently a CS PhD student at Princeton University. Before coming to Princeton, I worked in the optical design
    group and computer vision group (Switzerland) at Magic Leap and contributed to AR headset products Magic Leap One and Magic Leap Two.
    Through my multidisciplinary experience, I developed broad interests in optics, 3D computer vision, and human visual system. 
    
    Optics is probably niche, compared to deep learning etc., but it's fun and I'm really into it. Therefore, I hope to find neat applications of optical concepts, devices and systems in the world of the computer vision to 
    improve its start-of-the-art performance and to bridge the gap between imaging hardware and algorithms.

    As someone who messes up with cameras and pixels almost every day, I do care about photography (no specific causal relationship). 
    Street photography is my favorite subject - it's honest, dynamic, and creative. I am sensitive to the environment and people around and 
    enjoy capturing how human interact with the world.
